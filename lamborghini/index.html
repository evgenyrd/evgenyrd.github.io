            The Huracán EVO represents the natural evolution of the most successful V10 in Lamborghini history. It is the result of fine-tuning and consolidation which involves the already existing features and performance of Huracán, combined with the development of new solutions in terms of efficiency and design. But overall this vehicle stands out for its ability to anticipate the moves and satisfy the desires of the driver, in harmony with the Lamborghini DNA.<br/>

            The design of the Huracán EVO does not present a radical change in the original iconic shape and proportions, rather it represents a natural evolution that introduces sophisticated aerodynamic solutions, while remaining faithful to the iconic Lamborghini design. The front bumper adopts unmistakable Lamborghini design cues such as signature Y-shape stylistic elements, bonnet lines inspired by the Countach, skirt air ducts reminiscent of the Murciélago, and high-mounted exhaust tailpipes that recall the highest performing models of the Lamborghini range.These elements produce an evolution projected towards the future that does not forget the past.

            All the systems controlling the driving dynamics were updated, while new technologies were introduced to guarantee maximum performance of the Evo. The Lamborghini Inertial Platform (LIP) provides accurate real-time updates of the car’s behavior. The vehicle’s vertical dynamics are managed by the magnetorheological suspension (LMS) system. Additionally, its lateral dynamics are handled by a steering system which engages the four wheels through the Lamborghini Dynamic Steering (LDS) and the Lamborghini All-wheel Steering (LAWS) systems, aided by the constant distribution of the torque between the two axles (AWD) and the torque vectoring system. Combined with traction control, these systems also govern longitudinal dynamics. All of that is supervised by the Lamborghini Integrated Vehicle Dynamics (LDVI) system, a centralized controller capable of interpreting the pilot’s intentions and seamlessly adapting the vehicle’s behavior to them. This way, the driving emotion remains unparalleled within the segment.
